# Website Crawler

# 🕷️ Website Crawler API

The **Website Crawler API** allows developers to programmatically crawl websites and access structured metadata via two simple endpoints. This API gives you clean JSON responses and real-time crawl updates. The JSON/structured response generated by the /crawl/cwdata endpoint can be used for a variety of purpose. For example, as the data is JSON/LLM ready format, you can use it to train an AI model, use it for creating chatbots, audit websites, etc.

## 🔐 Authentication

To use the API, you'll need an **API Key**.

**How to get one:**
1. Visit [websitecrawler.org](https://www.websitecrawler.org)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Go to the **Settings** page to generate your API key

Pass your key as a query parameter (`key`) in all requests.

## 🧩 Integration Example: XML Sitemap Generator

This section highlights how the [`XML-Sitemap-Generator`](https://github.com/pc8544/XML-Sitemap-Generator) project uses the `websitecrawler.org` API to automate XML sitemap generation.

### 🔄 Integration Workflow

The following steps outline the flow between the Website Crawler API and the sitemap generation logic:

1. **Start Crawling**
   - Use the `crawl/start` endpoint to initiate crawling of your website:
     ```bash
     https://www.websitecrawler.org/api/crawl/start?url=example.com&limit=100&key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```

2. **Fetch Crawled Data**
   - Once crawling is complete, retrieve data using:
     ```bash
     https://www.websitecrawler.org/api/crawl/cwdata?url=example.com&key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - Response includes structured metadata (titles, links, status codes, etc.) in JSON format.

3. **Process and Transform**
   - The XML Sitemap Generator parses the response and extracts valid URLs.

4. **Generate Sitemap**
   - The extracted URLs are then converted into a compliant `sitemap.xml` for SEO optimization and better search engine indexing.

For best results, ensure your API key is valid and your domain permits crawling.
