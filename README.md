# Website Crawler

# üï∑Ô∏è Website Crawler API

The **Website Crawler API** allows developers to programmatically crawl websites and access structured metadata via four simple endpoints. This API gives you clean JSON responses and real-time crawl updates. The JSON/structured response generated by the /crawl/cwdata endpoint can be used for a variety of purpose. For example, as the data is JSON/LLM ready format, you can use it to train an AI model, use it for creating chatbots, audit websites, etc.

---

## üîê Authentication

To use the API, you'll need an **API Key**.

**How to get one:**
1. Visit [websitecrawler.org](https://www.websitecrawler.org)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Go to the **Settings** page to generate your API key

# üï∏Ô∏è Website Crawler API Usage Demo

The Python, Java, nodejs demos showcases how to use the `WebsiteCrawlerSDK` to interact with [websitecrawler.org](https://www.websitecrawler.org), enabling automated URL submission, status tracking, and retrieval of crawl data via their API.

## Python

install the website crawler sdk
```
pip install website-crawler-sdk

```
change API_KEY,YOUR_LIMIT,YOUR_URL in the following demo script and run it. The objective of this script is to submit a URL to websitecrawler.org, get crawl status, the current URL being processed by websitecrawler in realtime, and retrieve the structured data once the task of crawling the website is finished.

```

### How to use the Java library?

Download the jar file WebsiteCrawlerSDK-Java-1.0.jar and add it as a dependency in your java project. Create the WebsiteCrawlerConfig object as shown in the following code. Pass the WebsiteCrawlerConfig object to WebsiteCrawlerClient. Use the WebsiteCrawlerConfig object to call the methods.

```java
WebsiteCrawlerConfig config = new WebsiteCrawlerConfig("YOUR_API_KEY");
WebsiteCrawlerClient crawler = new WebsiteCrawlerClient(config);
```

```java

package wc.WebsiteCrawlerAPIUsageDemo;

import wc.websitecrawlersdk.WebsiteCrawlerClient;
import wc.websitecrawlersdk.WebsiteCrawlerConfig;

/**

        WebsiteCrawlerClient client = new WebsiteCrawlerClient(cfg);

        client.submitUrlToWebsiteCrawler(URL, LIMIT); //replace "URL" with the URL you want Websitecrawler.org to crawl and the number of URLs
        boolean taskStatus;
        while (true) {
            taskStatus = client.getTaskStatus(); //getTaskStatus() should be true before you call any methods
            System.out.println(taskStatus + "<<task status");
            Thread.sleep(9000);
            if (taskStatus == true) {
                status = client.getCrawlStatus(); // getCrawlStatus() method returns the live crawling status

                        Thread.sleep(20000); // JSON data might be huge. Thread.sleep makes the program wait until json data is retrieved
                        break; // exits the while(true) loop

## üß© Integration Example: XML Sitemap Generator

This section highlights how the [`XML-Sitemap-Generator`](https://github.com/pc8544/XML-Sitemap-Generator) project uses the `websitecrawler.org` API to automate XML sitemap generation.

### üîÑ Integration Workflow

The following steps outline the flow between the Website Crawler API and the sitemap generation logic:

1. **Start Crawling**
   - Use the `crawl/start` endpoint to initiate crawling of your website:
     ```bash
     https://www.websitecrawler.org/api/crawl/start?url=example.com&limit=100&key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```

2. **Fetch Crawled Data**
   - Once crawling is complete, retrieve data using:
     ```bash
     https://www.websitecrawler.org/api/crawl/cwdata?url=example.com&key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
   - Response includes structured metadata (titles, links, status codes, etc.) in JSON format.

3. **Process and Transform**
   - The XML Sitemap Generator parses the response and extracts valid URLs.

4. **Generate Sitemap**
   - The extracted URLs are then converted into a compliant `sitemap.xml` for SEO optimization and better search engine indexing.

### üìÇ Repository

For best results, ensure your API key is valid and your domain permits crawling.
